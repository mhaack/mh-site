Together with my colleague [Mark J. Becker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marbec/) I wrote an introduction and instructions on how to use AEM Content Fragments together with the Adobe Commerce (aka. Magento) PWA.

We provide step-by-step instructions that explain the individual tasks in detail, using a blog example - starting with setting up the PWA with the help of PWA Studio, via setting up the GraphQL endpoint in Adobe Experience Manager, managemnet of the content fragment models and content fragments itself and up to deployment.
