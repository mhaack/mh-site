This year, I once again had the honour of speaking at the [adaptTo() 2025](https://adapt.to/2025/schedule/unlocking-edge-delivery-authoring-with-authorbus) conference in Berlin.

Together with my colleague Max Voos, I introduced a new authoring paradigm for AuthorBus (formerly Dark Alley aka. DA) in a session.

We demonstrate how AuthorBus integrates with Universal Editor and Edge Delivery Services, providing attendees with insight into its technical architecture and underlying mechanics. The talk covered implementation requirements and best practices for adoption, showcasing this innovative approach to content authoring on DA. It enables content creators to transparently switch between free-form, document-based authoring and guided WYSIWYG authoring using Universal Editor.
