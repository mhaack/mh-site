We recently had the opportunity to present at [adaptTo()](https://adapt.to/2024) in Berlin, one of the most anticipated tech conferences in the Adobe Experience Manager community. Together with my colleague [Anian Weber ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anianweber/)we delivered an in-depth session on AEM Edge Delivery Services, focusing on how its capabilities have evolved well beyond small blog websites and basic corporate pages. Our talk aimed to answer a critical question: _Is it feasible to implement complex, multilingual, and multisite projects using AEM Edge Delivery Services while preserving the performance, flexibility, and ease of use it promises?_

### Key Takeaways from Our Talk

Our presentation explored strategic approaches to designing and managing global, multilanguage projects within the AEM Edge Delivery framework. Based on real-world projects and challenges we’ve encountered, we walked attendees through essential steps in setting up large-scale projects, from effective developer configurations and content organization strategies to optimized translation workflows.

For those interested in diving deeper into these topics, our [slide deck is available on the adaptTo() conference website](https://adapt.to/2024/schedule/scaling-up-implement-large-scale-projects-on-aem-edge-delivery-services). And stay tuned—the full recording of our talk will be available soon!

### Final Thoughts

In addition to our presentation, I also had the pleasure of participating in an expert panel discussion on Adobe Edge Delivery Services. This session was a great chance to connect with AEM developers and learn about their thoughts & questions about the potential and challenges of Edge Delivery.

Presenting at adaptTo() Berlin was a fantastic experience, and I'm excited to see how AEM Edge Delivery Services continues to transform as a robust solution for complex, multilingual projects. Thank you to everyone who attended our session and engaged with us during the panel discussion!

For anyone interested in implementing AEM Edge Delivery for large-scale, global projects, feel free to reach out—we’re always excited to discuss insights and share knowledge on this evolving platform.
