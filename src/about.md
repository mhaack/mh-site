Hi, I'm Markus Haack and this site is my virtual online home, my little corner of the internet.

### Home in the world

Together with my wonderful wife, our daughter, and our 2 cats I live in the beautiful city of Leipzig, Germany.

If time allows I play with Nintendo consoles, old and new ones. I'm interested in various electronic topics, Arduino microcontrollers & IOT stuff. I'm passionate about smart homes, <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="__blank">Home Assistant</a> in particular and automating our house with all kinds of useful and useless smart devices. I wrote about my [Home Assistant journey](/home-assistant) and some of [my projects](/projects) here as well.
