Our home's solar energy system continued its upward trajectory in 2024. In fact, compared to previous years, it provided a slight increase in energy production. This post looks at our solar performance in 2024, highlighting key trends and comparing them with the results from 2021, 2022 and 2023.

## 2024: A Bountiful Harvest of Solar Energy

In 2024, our solar panels generated a total of 8571 kWh, an improvement on 2023 but slightly lower than 2022. This represents a step towards greater energy independence and, of course, a lower energy bill. As expected, the data clearly shows a seasonal pattern:

* **Peak Production (June & July):** June and July were our most productive months with 1246 kWh and 1279 kWh respectively. This highlights the effectiveness of our system during peak sunlight hours. July & August 2024 had the highest energy yield compared to July & August of previous years. May was still good with a production of 1,140 kWh, but it looks like we had much less sun in May in 2024 compared to previous years.
* **Lowest Production (December & January):** As expected, December (132 kWh) and January (181 kWh) had the lowest production due to shorter daylight hours and less intense solar radiation. However, both of these months were the best since our records began. In previous years, we did not even reach > 100 kWh in these winter months.

## Last 4 Years of our Energy Production

The table below provides a comparison of our energy production and consumption across the years 2021-2024:

| Year | Solar Energy Production | Electricity Consumption | Grid Electricity Used | Self-Consumption | Self-Consumption Quota |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2021 | 7780 kWh                | 9721 kWh                | 4677 kWh              | 5044 kWh         | 52 %                   |
| 2022 | 9104 kWh                | 10192 kWh               | 4552 kWh              | 5640 kWh         | 55 %                   |
| 2023 | 8292 kWh                | 10361 kWh               | 5181 kWh              | 5180 kWh         | 50 %                   |
| 2024 | 8571 kWh                | 10297 kWh               | 4994 kWh              | 5303 kWh         | 52 %                   |

## Energy Consumption: A Relatively Stable Baseline

Our total electricity consumption for 2024 was 10297 kWh, a relatively stable figure compared to recent years. The increase in solar energy production in 2024 compared to 2023 allowed us to self-consume 5303 kWh, reducing our reliance on the grid to just 4894 kWh. This reduced our grid dependency by ~100 kWh.
Unfortunately, due to rising electricity prices in Germany, this is not reflected in the electricity costs. 

## Outlook: Changes in sight - or not

The year 2024 was similar to previous years, both in terms of solar energy production and our consumption. There has been no major change. However, we have noticed a slight increase in electricity production compared to previous years, especially in the winter months, as we have less snow and frost. We can also observe this in January 2025.

Overall, we do not expect any fundamental changes in 2025. By changing the electricity provider, we will probably be able to further reduce the electricity costs for grid purchases. We may also switch to a dynamic electricity tariff later in the year.
