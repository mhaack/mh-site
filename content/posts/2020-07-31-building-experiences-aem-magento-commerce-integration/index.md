I want to share some proffesional project I'm working on. On July 28th I was a guest on Mark Szulc's show Building Experiences using Adobe Experience Cloud. We discussed how Adobe Experience Manager works together with Magento, using the latest release of the Commerce Integration Framework. [Commerce Integration Framework](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components) is build by our AEM Commerce team at Adobe.
