I want to share some professional projects I'm working on: Commerce Integration Framework and the [AEM CIF Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components) are built by the team I'm working for at Adobe. 

On July 28th I was a guest on Mark Szulc's [Building Experiences using Adobe Experience Cloud show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8zeS_5A2HxNA5-vKtIrtqg). We discussed how Adobe Experience Manager works together with Magento, using the latest release of the Commerce Integration Framework. I explained how projects can use the power of CIF and how we support AEM as a Cloud Services.

Check out the recording of the live stream:
