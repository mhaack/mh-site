This year's AdaptTo 2023 conference in Berlin brought an exciting twist to my speaking journey. Unlike previous years, where AdaptTo conference was only virtually, I had the incredible opportunity to hold a keynote presentation in person.

During this [keynote](https://adapt.to/2023/schedule/edge-delivery-services-getting-started-with-document-based-authoring), I gave an introduction into the innovation of Adobe AEM Sites â€“ Document-based Authoring combined with Edge Delivery Services, also known as Project Franklin. This next evolution of AEM Sites introduces a fresh authoring and developer experience, promising to create blazingly fast websites.

The presentation covered the architecture of the Edge Delivery Services stack and the core concepts of document-based authoring. It's packed with practical details to help developers kickstart their projects and quickly launch their own websites.
