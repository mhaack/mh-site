We recently had the opportunity to present at adaptTo() in Berlin, one of the most anticipated tech conferences in the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) community. Together with my colleague , we delivered an in-depth session on AEM Edge Delivery Services, focusing on how its capabilities have evolved well beyond small microsites and basic corporate pages. Our talk aimed to answer a critical question: *Is it feasible to implement complex, multilingual, and multisite projects using AEM Edge Delivery Services while preserving the performance, flexibility, and ease of use it promises?*

### Key Takeaways from Our Talk

Our presentation explored strategic approaches to designing and managing global, multilanguage projects within the AEM Edge Delivery framework. Based on real-world projects and challenges we’ve encountered, we walked attendees through essential steps in setting up large-scale projects, from effective developer configurations and content organization strategies to optimized translation workflows.

**Here’s a quick overview of what we covered:**

- **Project Setup**: Best practices for developers looking to maximize efficiency in complex AEM Edge Delivery projects.
- **Content Organization**: Strategies to handle vast content libraries and streamline content management for multiple languages and locales.
- **Translation Workflows**: How to optimize translation processes to ensure timely, accurate, and contextually relevant content across different regions.
